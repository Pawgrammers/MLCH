# Shakespeare Script Editor (MLCH)

The Shakespeare Script Editor is a website made by team MLCH for CS121: Software Development in the Spring 2017 semester. The website allows users to choose a Shakespeare from a list or find one using a search bar, read the play, and cut words from the play. The script editor also analyzes each play, providing line numbers, a synopsis, and a navigation bar with the number of acts and scenes in the play.
